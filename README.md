We studied the age of the persons involved in car accidents in 2023 and we noticed a disproportionate amount of young drivers(20- 30 years old) involved in car accidents.

Indeed, the young drivers represent 34% of the global accident, Yet they are only 10% in the population. 

We tried to come up with potential explanations : 

-Lack of experience (bad perception of danger )
,Used car
,Reckless driving (speed, or alcohol)
,Social pressure / driving with others

## Then we were also expected to derive or model a cost for a single accident that takes place in France.

As we tried to be as data driven as possible we based our data from the VSI/VSSI provided by the EU that indicates the value of life for a severe injury and value of life incase of death; Basing on these value we also came to understand that when we are calculating the cost of an accident other things are in hand such as the cost of properties damaged or even the productivity loss since this person will have sick leave days and not only this but also when he comes back to work his productivity will not be the same so with all this in play we came up with a cost as indicated in the documentation above.
